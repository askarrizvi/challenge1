# Code Refactor Starter Code
Description:
This git repository contains the source code for the Horiseon Social Solution Services webpage.
The source code has been refactored and cleaned up for ease of readability and efficiency. Some of the modifications include changing non-semantic HTML elements to semantic HTML elements, removing duplicate CSS styling code, and reordering the code to be in a logical and more readable manner. The image tags have been modified to include the "alt" attribute for better compatibility with accessibility standards. The links have also been fixed and the title has been modified to better represent the webpage. Finally, comments have been added to the code to make the code more readable.
